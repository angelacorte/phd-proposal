abstract = {Pervasive and mobile computing call for suitable middleware and programming models to support the activities of complex software systems in dynamic network environments. In this article we present TOTA (“Tuples On The Air”), a novel middleware and programming approach for supporting adaptive context-aware activities in pervasive and mobile computing scenarios. The key idea in TOTA is to rely on spatially distributed tuples, adaptively propagated across a network on the basis of application-specific rules, for both representing contextual information and supporting uncoupled interactions between application components. TOTA promotes a simple way of programming that facilitates access to distributed information, navigation in complex environments, and the achievement of complex coordination tasks in a fully distributed and adaptive way, mostly freeing programmers and system managers from the need to take care of low-level issues related to network dynamics. This article includes both application examples to clarify concepts and performance figures to show the feasibility of the approach},

abstract = {Many interesting systems in several disciplines can be modeled as networks of nodes that can store and exchange data: pervasive systems, edge computing scenarios, and even biological and bio-inspired systems. These systems feature inherent complexity, and often simulation is the preferred (and sometimes the only) way of investigating their behavior; this is true both in the design phase and in the verification and testing phase. In this tutorial paper, we provide a guide to the simulation of such systems by leveraging Alchemist, an existing research tool used in several works in the literature. We introduce its meta-model and its extensible architecture; we discuss reference examples of increasing complexity; and we finally show how to configure the tool to automatically execute multiple repetitions of simulations with different controlled variables, achieving reliable and reproducible results.},

abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is emerging as a ubiquitous and dense ecosystem in which novel devices and smart objects interoperate to establish smart cities, smart buildings, etc. In such application contexts, a plethora of innovative services are expected to stand out, deeply impacting our daily routine. In particular, real IoT drivers will be cyberphysical, collective, highly dynamic and contextualised services, called in the following Opportunistic IoT Services. This work proposes a full-fledged approach for their development, based on (i) a technology-agnostic yet detailed modelling phase, which allows opportunistic properties to emerge since the preliminary service analysis; and (ii) the implementation and further simulation of IoT services through Aggregate Computing, a distributed computing paradigm and engineering stack able to harness, in practice, the dynamic, collective and context-driven nature of Opportunistic IoT Services. A mass event case study, related to the real-world scenario of a large scale urban crowds detection and steering, provides evidence of the huge potential of the approach: indeed, simulation results highlight the effectiveness, flexibility, scalability and resilience of the Aggregate Computing-based approach to the design of Opportunistic IoT Services.},

abstract = {Collective Adaptive System (CAS) as a broad term refers to todays observable indications of a deployment of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) at a very large scale (e.g. 3.5*109 personal computers, 6.2*109 smart phones, 1.1*109 cars on planet). Taking such a massive ICT deployment, it is not just considered possible, but already a reality that these are programmed to operate cooperatively as very large scale collectives. As for example, smartphone apps have demonstrated globe-spanning cooperative sensing applications, liquid democracy applications, logistics and traffic management applications, energy management applications, etc.One essential aspect of such globe-spanning ICT collectives is that they often exhibit properties typical observed in complex systems, like (i) spontaneous, dynamic network configuration, with (ii) individual nodes acting in parallel, (iii) constantly acting and reacting to what the other agents are doing, and (iv) where the control tends to be highly dispersed and decentralized. If there is to be any coherent behavior observed on the level of the collective (macro-level), it (v) it usually arises from competition and cooperation among the individual elements (micro-level). The overall behavior of the collective (macro-behaviour) is the result of (vi) a huge number of decisions made every moment by many individual entities (micro-interactions), possibly leading to (vii) the emergence of unexpected phenomena.A critical challenge for CAS is to design and implement collectives able to operate in a more or less autonomous way, with little or no human interaction. In this endeavor, self-adaptation and self-management have emerged as two interrelated facets of CASs.Self-adaptive collectives in a top down strategy evaluate their own global behavior and change it when the evaluation indicates that they are not accomplishing what they were intended to do, or when better function or performance is possible. Here a challenge is to identify how to change the behaviors of the individuals so as to achieve the desired collective improvement. In self-managing collectives, individuals interact locally, typically according to a small set simple rules. Achieving a desirable collective behaviour is attempted with a bottom up strategy, in that local interaction policies are adopted so as to steer global behavior. Self-organisation is the process of enabling a system to change its organisation in case of environmental changes without explicit external command. We can distinguish between: weak self-organisation where from an internal point of view, there is re-organisation under an internal central control or planning; and strong-selforganisation (also referred to as "emergence"), where there is re-organisation with no explicit central control, either internal or external [1]. Building upon the mechanisms of self-adaptation and self-management, we may ask the questions on the potentials and opportunities of turning massively deployed systems to a globe spanning superorganism of socially interactive elements [2]. While the individual elements are of heterogeneous provenance and typically act autonomously, we can assume that they can (and will) self-configure into large scale cooperative collectives, either with or without human governance [3,4]. We may not assume a common objective or central control, but rather volatile network topologies, codependence and internal competition, non-linear and non-continuous dynamics, and sub-ideal, failure prone operation. The recent literature has referred to these emerging massive collectives as "superorganisms" [5], since they exhibit properties of a living organism (like e.g. 'collective intelligence') on its own. In order to properly exploit such superorganisms, we need to develop a deeper scientific understanding of the foundational principles by which they operate.},
